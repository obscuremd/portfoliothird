## Overview

I was tasked with building a secure, scalable cloud storage solution that allows users to store and access files from any device, with AI-powered recovery capabilities. I used Next.js for its performance and server-side rendering, Node.js for backend logic, and MongoDB for data storage. The UI was designed to be intuitive and user-centric using ShadCN UI and UX best practices. The project was successfully delivered to the AI team for integration.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Integrated Clerk to ensure robust user authentication and data protection.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed the database for scalability, allowing seamless migration to more advanced solutions as user and data volume grow.
- **Optimized Storage**: Implemented file compression via third-party cloud services to reduce storage usage without compromising quality.
- **User-Centric Design**: Created an intuitive, accessible UI tailored for a broad user base while maintaining full feature accessibility.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma**: For designing intuitive and accessible user interfaces.
- **React and Next.js**: For building a fast, modular frontend with reusable components and server-side rendering.
- **Shadcn UI**: For implementing consistent and dynamic styling using design tokens.
- **MongoDB**: For flexible and scalable database management.
- **Vercel**: For deployment and continuous CI/CD integration to streamline updates.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the major problems I encountered was designing a scalable backend and database structure to handle complex relationships between users, files, and folders. Each user could own multiple files, organize them into folders, and perform asynchronous actions like uploads, updates, and deletions across nested routes.

## Outcome

I addressed this by creating optimized data models for users, files, and folders, and implementing asynchronous APIs to manage complex operations efficiently. I also optimized the frontend to handle real-time updates, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.

This project taught me valuable skills in building scalable backends capable of handling multiple asynchronous operations without delays, and in developing a seamless, optimized frontend for high-performance tasks. It significantly challenged and helped me grow as both a designer and a developer.
